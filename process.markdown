# Process

### Step 1: User Stories

We interact with you for 30-90 minutes, get to know about your idea and form user
stories that clearly define the scope of the project. We add the stories on
a project management tool like pivotal tracker.

### Step 2: Estimate

Once agreed on the user stories, we estimate the complexity of each story and
give you a time frame and budget. 

### Step 3: Sprints

Once agreed on the time frame, we break the stories down into sprints and establish a project schedule with weekly deliverables

### Step 4: Feedback

We set up a staging server where our [continous delivery manager](http://jenkins-ci.org/) will automatically deploy the latest code we push. You can check the status of your project anytime on our staging server and provide us feedback

### Step 5: Acceptance

Once we deliver a user story, you can test it out on staging server and accept the story or give us feedback if any

### Step 6: Completion

Once all the stories have been accepted by you, we prepare the project for delivery and give you a documentation of our work
