#MidnightAuthor

__Time:__ 15th 8pm to 16th Dec 9am

_“A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.”_ ― Andrew Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master.

Writing is a very important skill for a programmer. Having the ability to express abstract concepts in simple understandable language is key to stand out from the crowd. A step toward this direction is writing your first blog post.

##Topics
1. Compare and contrast inheritance in Ruby and Java.
2. What are some of the cool things you can do with `method_missing`?
3. Ruby and syntactic sugar.

##Rules of the game
No person can write about the same topic. If two or more people write about the same topic, then only the first blog will be considered. Please turn in you posts by 9am tomorrow. Create a `markdown` [Gist](https://gist.github.com) with the blog contents and email the link to me at [nithin@codebrahma.com](mailto:nithin@codebrahma.com).

The best post will go onto the Codebrahma blog.

Happy Authoring!
