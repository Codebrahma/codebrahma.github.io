This is my personal experience about the Garden City Ruby Conference - 2014, which happened in Hotel Atria, Bangalore. We sponsored the conference and were given 2 complementry tickets. So, me and Nithin(one of my colleague's) went to the conference.

## January 3rd - Day 1

We reached the Hotel by 9:10 AM and we were invited in the hospitality desk. Since the tickets were sponsorship ticket's, they were in the name of Anand(our Founder & CEO). The girl in the desk asked for our names and we both told "Anand", at the same time. The girl was pretty confused and gave us both a weird look. Then I wasted one long sentence in my life explaining her the situation. Now everything went cool and she gave each of us a bunch of goodies and conference tags.


### Keynote - Chad Fowler([@chadfowler](https://twitter.com/chadfowler "Chad's twitter profile"))

I had no idea who Chad was. The compere [Swanand](https://twitter.com/_swanand "Swanand's twitter profile") introduced him as "the person who does not need any introduction's". So, I opened up my phone and googled for "Chad Fowler", I got his [github profile](https://github.com/chad "Chad's github profile"). I saw all his contributions. I came to know that he is a cool guy, not only in ruby but also in many other languages and frameworks.

Now I started listening to this guy. He was trying to show off. But the way he showed off, impressed me. His keynote was entirely very abstract, not related to ruby or rails, but it was very genralized.

### Tea/Coffee Break

Something interesting happened during the break. I saw my college friend [Vysakh](https://twitter.com/vysakh0 "Vysakh's twitter profile"), we chatted along and introduced Nithin to him. We already started having this guys talk.

### Lessons Learnt Building India's Largest E-Commerce Supply Chain in Ruby - Yogi Kulkarni([@YogiKulkarni](https://twitter.com/YogiKulkarni "Yogi's twitter profile"))

Yogi is a very experienced guy, who worked for ThoughtWorks and moved to Flipkart. He was one of the first employee's of flipkart. He is now the Principal Architect at Flipkart. He started to talk about the way the inital flipkart architecture was. It just contained 4 modules and it was too complex to handle the requests, once flipkart grew more and more. So they dediced to entirely change the architecture and designed a new complex one, which address the scaling problem.

He also talked about JRuby, and it's advantages and disadvantages. He showed different monitoring tools for monitoring different parameters used by them in flipkart.

### Native Extensions Served 3 Ways - Tejas Dinkar([@tdinkar](https://twitter.com/tdinkar "Tejas's twitter profile"))

Tejas started with a small code to show how include 'ruby.h' and write some ruby like code in a python program.

He talked about Foreign Function Interface(FFI) for converting native code to ruby. He gave a solid point that when we use FFI, we should take care of GC manually. He also talked about [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/ "SWIG home page"), which is an acronym for Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator used for connecting programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. 

### Invited Talk - Coby Randquist([@kobier](https://twitter.com/kobier "Koby's twitter profile"))

Coby is the founder of [confreaks(http://confreaks.com/ "Confreaks home page")]. This talk was basically about how confreaks was founded and the path in which confreaks came though etc.

### Lunch

The lunch was a buffet, with variety of foods. They provided fish, chicken, prawn, ghee rice, paneer makhni etc. And deserts were served too. We guys met with other fellow developers and were discussing about a variety of things. I got introduced by vysakh to [Dheeraj Kumar](https://twitter.com/codepodu "Dheeraj's twitter profile") and [Vamsee Kanakala](https://twitter.com/vamsee "Vamsee's twitter profile"). We talked with these guys for a while and we were chased away for the next speech. And thus, an awesome lunch came to an end.

### The Rails Girls Summer of Code journey - Sakshi Jain, Pallavi Shastry

These girls Sakshi Jain and Pallavi Shastry were the only team from india to attend the Rails Girls Summer of Code(RGSoC). Their team name was diasbits. They were an inspiration to all the girls and even the guys in the entire conference hall. They were so enthusiastic and walked through thier experience in contributing to a open source repository called [diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora "Diaspora's github page"). Apparently every one encouraged them.

### Panel Discussion - Chad Fowler, Baishampayan Ghose, Yogi Kulkarni, Venkat Subramaniyan, Hemant Kumar

This was a discussion on the various programming languages. I was surprised to hear that, most people in the dias were not very much happy with ruby. But people still it's a ruby conf, not a clojure conf or erlang conf. So ruby was torn into pieces in the dias. So be it. But the arguments and questions by the participants was a sweet thing to hear. The entire debate like discussion was an awesome experience to learn the names of different languages.

### Simple Ruby DSL Techniques: Big Project Impact - [Aman King](http://www.amanking.com/ "Aman's home page")

This was a beautiful talk on ruby's DSL techniques. We were given intro to the existing 3 types of DSL's in ruby, they were

- Fluent Interface
- Single line declarations and
- Block declarations

We were also shown how to write manual DSL's in each of the 3 types.

The slides and code snipets are in [this](http://www.slideshare.net/amanking/simple-ruby-dsl-techniques-big-project-impact "Simple Ruby DSL Techniques: Big Project Impact!") sideshare link.

### Keynote - Prateek Dayal([@prateekdayal](https://twitter.com/prateekdayal "Prateek's twitter profile"))

This keynote speak was about Prateek's journey as an entrepreneur. His [muziboo](http://www.muziboo.com/ " muziboo's home page") days and the downfall of muziboo. His resurruction from the failure and his [supportbee](https://supportbee.com/ "supportbee's home page").

This was an awesome day and we met many fellow developers. The most interesting talk was the one given by Chad and Aman. Of course not to mention, the panel discussion.
