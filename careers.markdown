#### Make Dhoni introduce himself again!

{% gist 6318439 %}

#### T9

T9 typing is cool, it's elegant. It's unfortunately a dying art.
Fork this page http://jsfiddle.net/W2LBN/ and try to implement t9 typing on this phone.

#### Color Game

Provide a textbox for user to enter their name, once they hit enter then each letter of his/her name should be written within the circle and each circle should have random background colour. The program should also generate n number of radio buttons where n = name.length(). When the user clicks k'th radio button, then colors of concurring k circles should be combined to produce a new color and the color should be applied to those k circles as background.

Here is an example:
