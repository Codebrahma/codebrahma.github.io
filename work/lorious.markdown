### About

Lorious is the place to find experts in your domain. You can schedule
consulting sessions with them.

The site is built on angularjs and has a cool calendar that we use for
scheduling.

Also we built and integrated google hangout into the system so that experts and
their clients can talk to each other on the platform itself.
