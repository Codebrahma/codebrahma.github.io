# Node-JS

The fundamental difference between Nodejs and other frameworks like
Rails/Django is that Nodejs is asynchronous and event driven by nature.

#### How event driven helps you?

When you write fairly complex web applications, you are often waiting for some
process. To send an email, waiting for response from your ticketing API,
waiting for a CHAT message from your peers. During such process's non event
driven servers wait on these process, thereby giving your user a lag. Nodejs,
takes advantage of javascripts event loop, leaves an asynchronous callback to
take care of such process and goes onto give your users a seemless experience.

#### When Should I use Nodejs?

When you need your APP to do Realtime processing, like querying multiple Flight
Ticketing Servers or a realtime chat/notification system use Nodejs.

When all you want to do is build a database backed application, building it on Rails
will save you time.
