You have a working prototype ready, you have demoed it to a few people, and
they love your product, and now you want to take it to the masses.

But you arent very confident about your codebase. 

1. It throws exceptions every now and then.
2. Tough to Scale, because of a huge monolithic codebase
3. Response time is slow.
4. Change is not welcomed by your developers, they dont want to change working
   code

performance and grace matters.
